Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

Haron Yunis

Problem 2:
GC-content: 0.43029262963
...

Problem 3:It came out as an error beacuse every variable needs a value for the sequence to work. Taking out the vaules using # made the information run as undefined. 
This happened for all sequence in the text seq, gc_count and linenum

Problem 4:
GC -content: 0.43029262963
AT -content: 0.5689938518852

problem 5
# next, if the bp is a G or a C,
    if bp == 'C' or bp == 'G':
        # increment the count of gc
        gc_count = gc_count + 1
    if bp == 'A' or bp == 'T':
        at_count = at_count + 1
    if bp == 'C': 
          c_count = c_count + 1
    if bp == 'T':
         t_count = t_count +1   
sum_count = gc_count + at_count   
# divide the gc_count by the total_count
gc_content = float(gc_count) / total_count
# divide the at_count by total_count
at_content = float(at_count) / total_count
# Print the answer
print 'GC-content:', gc_content
print 'AT-content:', at_content
print "c_count:" , c_count
print "t_count:" , t_count
print "Sum_count:", sum_count
print "Total_count:", total_count
print "seq_length:", seq_length
print "AT_GC_Ratio:", AT_GC_Ratio 
print "GC_Classification:", GC_Classification  

#Problem 6 sanity check
Test High 1 and Test high 2 are different 
Test high 1 total = 11800
Test high 2 total = 40000
 They also differ in sum amounts too

Test Moderate 1 and 2 differ in sum amount
1 is sum = 39841
2 sum = 39811

Sample.fastq All different. only 1 and 2 have the same total count!

Collaboration:
My patner on this assignment was Ahmed Ali. 
...

Reflection:
This assignment thought me that a large amount of data can be run at the same time by 
my terminal and editing a file on python can change the output of such file. this assignment took 
me longer than should have all beacuse of one word that i misspelled. My advise to fututre students is to slow down when typing 
and not be like me because one letter can be a big difference when writing code.
